%description
A free, cross-platform AAA game engine deeply integrated with AWS and Twitch â€“
with full source code provided. Whether you are a major studio, an indie
developer, a student, or a hobbyist, this provides a growing set of tools to
create the highest-quality games, connect your games to the vast compute and
storage of the AWS Cloud, and engage fans on Twitch. These robust professional
tools help developers build games with beautiful worlds, realistic characters,
and stunning effects. Additionally, with AWS Cloud integration, developers can
add cloud-connected features to a game in as little as minutes (e.g. dynamic
content, daily news, leaderboards, or server-side combat resolution).
It is also integrated with Amazon GameLift, the AWS service for deploying,
operating, and scaling dedicated game servers for session-based multiplayer
games.
